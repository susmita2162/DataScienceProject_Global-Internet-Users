## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to:

1.  read in a data set, and describe the data set using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)
2.  identify what needs to be done to tidy the current data
3.  anticipate the shape of pivoted data
4.  pivot the data into tidy format using `pivot_longer`

## Read in data

Read in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.

-   animal_weights.csv ⭐
-   eggs_tidy.csv ⭐⭐ or organiceggpoultry.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   australian_marriage\*.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   USA Households\*.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐⭐
-   sce_labor_chart_data_public.xlsx 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

```{r}
# Reading eggs_tidy.csv dataset

library(readr)
eggs_tidy_data <- read_csv("_data/eggs_tidy.csv")
view(eggs_tidy_data)

```
```{r}
# Preview the first few rows of the dataset
head(eggs_tidy_data)

# Understanding the dimensions of the dataset 
dim(eggs_tidy_data)

```
```{r}
# Identifying the column names of the dataset 
colnames(eggs_tidy_data)

# Identifying the data types of the columns
table(sapply(eggs_tidy_data, function(x) typeof(x)))

# Summary of the dataset
summary(eggs_tidy_data)
```



### Briefly describe the data


This dataset gives the information about prices of different quantities and sizes of eggs in every month from the year 2004 to 2013.. It has 120 rows and 6 columns. Based on the above, we can infer that there are 1 column(variables) is of character datatype and 5 variables are of double datatype. All the columns are readable for the user. Each observation in the dataset is providing information about - month, year, prices of different quantities and sizes of eggs in a particular month and year. Based on the summary, we can say that average price for large_half_dozen is around 155.2, for large_dozen is around 254.2, for extra_large_half_dozen is 164.2 and extra_large_dozen is around 266.8. The dataset is put together in a way that size, quantity and respective price of the eggs are included in the same column. I want to pivot the data longer to make it more readable for analysis. I want to make different columns for size and quantity and mark the price for that month, year, size and quantity respectively. 


## Anticipate the End Result

The first step in pivoting the data is to try to come up with a concrete vision of what the end product *should* look like - that way you will know whether or not your pivoting was successful.

One easy way to do this is to think about the dimensions of your current data (tibble, dataframe, or matrix), and then calculate what the dimensions of the pivoted data should be.

Suppose you have a dataset with $n$ rows and $k$ variables. In our example, 3 of the variables are used to identify a case, so you will be pivoting $k-3$ variables into a longer format where the $k-3$ variable names will move into the `names_to` variable and the current values in each of those columns will move into the `values_to` variable. Therefore, we would expect $n * (k-3)$ rows in the pivoted dataframe!


```{r}
#existing rows/cases in the dataset
nrow(eggs_tidy_data)

#existing columns in the dataset
ncol(eggs_tidy_data)

#expected rows/cases in the dataset
nrow(eggs_tidy_data) * (ncol(eggs_tidy_data)-2)

# expected columns in the dataset
3 + 2


```
### Challenge: Describe the final dimensions

From the above, we can say that the dataset has 120 rows(observations) and 6 columns in the dataset. After pivoting the dataset, I expect 480 rows/observations in the dataset with 5 columns. After pivoting, the observation will contain month, year, size, quantity and price of the eggs columns. With this we will be easily able to analyze the data. We can understand how the prices of different types, quantities of the eggs across different months, years are changing.


```{r}

```

### Challenge: Pivot the Chosen Data

Document your work here. What will a new "case" be once you have pivoted the data? How does it meet requirements for tidy data?

```{r}
eggs_pivot_data<-pivot_longer(eggs_tidy_data, cols = contains("dozen"),
                              names_to= c("size", "quantity"),
                              names_sep = "_",
                              values_to = "price")
View(eggs_pivot_data)
```
```{r}
# Preview the first few rows of the pivoted dataset
head(eggs_pivot_data)

# number of rows/cases in the pivot dataset
nrow(eggs_pivot_data)

# number of columns in the pivot dataset
ncol(eggs_pivot_data)

```

As expected, we can observe that the pivoted dataset has 480 observations with 5 columns(month, year, size, quantity and price of the eggs). This helps us to easily analyze the data. We can mutate the price of the eggs(from cents to USD).
```{r}
# Mutating the price of the eggs
eggs_price_mutated <-mutate(eggs_pivot_data, price_USD = price/100)%>%
  select(!contains("cost"))

View(eggs_price_mutated)

# Identifying the column names of the dataset 
colnames(eggs_price_mutated)

# Identifying the data types of the columns
table(sapply(eggs_price_mutated, function(x) typeof(x)))

```
The mutated data has an additional column price in USD for every observation. There are 3 character datatypes(month, size, quantity) columns and 3 columns are of double datatype(year, price, price_USD).
